# Thunor Web

**Thunor** (pronounced THOO-nor) is a free software platform for managing,
visualizing, and analyzing high throughput screen (HTS) data, which measure
the dose-dependent response of cells to one or more
drug(s). Thunor has a web interface for drag-and-drop upload of cell count
data, automatic calculation of dose response curves, and an interactive
multi-panelled plot system.

This repository, Thunor Web, is the web interface. Thunor Web builds on
[Thunor Core](https://github.com/alubbock/thunor), which is a Python package
that can be used for standalone analysis or integration into computational
pipelines.
